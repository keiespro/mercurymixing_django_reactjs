# Preact Redux Example

A **10kb** Redux-powered alternative to [preact-boilerplate](https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate).

> As of `v2`, now wonderfully simplified via [preact-redux](https://github.com/developit/preact-redux) (no more preact-compat!).

## Development Workflow

**1. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.


**2. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```

You can now deploy the contents of the `build` directory to production!
