This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It was ejected and modified to use [preact](https://preactjs.com/) instead of React, following the [migration guide](https://github.com/developit/preact-www/blob/bf62aeb0e584ae392b5df86ba2c05858e069c2b6/content/guide/switching-to-preact.md). We are not using `preact-compat` (optional migration).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
